UMass Mounter: Part II
======================

I left my thumb drive at work, so I wasn't able to get this up sooner.

Quick recap: we can get volume names, we know how to get notified of the
USB devices being plugged in and out, and we know how to map between umass
devices and SCSI devices. Here's what's left to do:

 * Write the script to respond to devices being plugged in and out
 * Set up device permissions so user can mount the devices themselves.
